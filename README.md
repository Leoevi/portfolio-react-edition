### Welcome to my dummy portfolio repo

This is just a repo that I created to test deploying a react app to github pages. This project is created using vite + react + ts template and is further modified to my liking.

### Deploying to github pages

The method that I used to deploy this react app to github pages follows closely with [this tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages). With the exception of [some modification](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74518887/blank-page-when-deploying-a-react-app-to-github-pages-and-vite) due to the fact that this project is created with vite instead of the create-react-app used in the tutorial
